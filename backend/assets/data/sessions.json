This unfortunate event led to me missing a few payments on my account. Additionally, there were a couple of instances where my bank had issues with the automatic payments. I contacted them immediately and was under the impression that it was resolved. Furthermore, during this period, I moved apartments and I believe some of the notifications regarding my account may have been sent to the wrong address. \n     \n\n     \n         Since then, I have regained employment and my financial situation has greatly improved.

I have noticed some discrepancies in my credit report, specifically related to late payments on this account. I understand the importance of timely payments and maintaining a good credit history, which is why I am reaching out to you today. \n     \n\n     \n         In 2022, I experienced a temporary financial strain due to losing my job. This unfortunate event led to me missing a few payments on my account. Additionally, there were some issues with my bank's automatic payment system, which resulted in further late payments. I did reach out to my bank to rectify the situation, but it seems the issue was not resolved in a timely manner. I believe that my change of residence during this period might have led to some communication gaps, as I did not receive any notices about the account going into collections. \n     \n\n     \n         Despite these challenges, I have made a concerted effort to get back on track. I have since resumed regular payments and have been managing the account well.

I have been diligent in making regular payments since overcoming my financial hardships and rectifying the issues with my bank's automatic payment system. I am hopeful that these late payment records can be reconsidered in light of the circumstances. \n            \n         \n        \n     \n    \n\n     \n         In light of the above, I kindly request a goodwill adjustment for the late payments on my account.

I am aware that my account has a history of late payments, which were unfortunately a result of a temporary job loss. I understand the importance of timely payments and I am committed to maintaining a good credit history. \n     \n\n     \n         During the time of the late payments, I was going through a difficult period in my life. I lost my job and was unable to meet my financial obligations. This situation was not only stressful but also unexpected. It was a hardship that I had not anticipated, and it had a significant impact on my ability to make timely payments on my auto loan. \n     \n\n     \n         I am pleased to inform you that I have since found stable employment and have resumed regular payments on my account. I have been making consistent efforts to catch up on the payments that I had missed and am dedicated to maintaining a good payment record moving forward. \n     \n\n    \n     \n         Relevant Account(s) \n        \n         \n              BMW FIN SVC  \u2014 Account #: 100493**** \u2014 Status: Open \n            \n               The account with BMW FIN SVC is my auto loan account. Due to the temporary job loss, I missed a couple of payments. However, since regaining employment, I have been making regular payments to rectify the situation. Despite these efforts, the late payments have negatively impacted my credit history. \n            \n         \n        \n     \n    \n\n     \n         In light of these circumstances, I kindly request your goodwill in adjusting the late payment records associated with my account. I believe that these records do not accurately reflect my current financial stability and commitment to making timely payments. I appreciate your understanding and consideration in this matter.

My name is Eithan Cherem, born on [REDACTED], and I am writing to you regarding my account with your esteemed organization, account number ending in ****.

However, I recently encountered a temporary hardship that affected my ability to meet my obligations in a timely manner.\n\nI experienced a temporary job loss which significantly impacted my financial stability. This unfortunate circumstance led to a couple of late payments on my account, as reflected in my credit report (2x30-day late reported to Transunion). I understand the importance of timely payments and I regret that I was unable to meet these obligations during this challenging period.\n\nSince then, I have regained employment and have been making consistent efforts to bring my account back into good standing.
