      <h2>Warning: Potential Duplicate Negative Reporting Detected</h2>
      <p>We noticed that your report might contain duplicate negative entries for the same debt (e.g., reported both as Charge-Off and Collection). This situation is more complex and may require manual review and a personalized dispute strategy. We recommend that you contact us directly so we can assist you with a tailored approach to address this properly.</p>
