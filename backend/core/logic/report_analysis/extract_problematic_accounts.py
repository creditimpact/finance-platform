"""Orchestrate extraction and case building for problematic accounts.

This module provides a thin wrapper that wires together the problem
extraction and case building steps.  It intentionally contains *no*
problem detection logic or file writing beyond delegating to the
specialised modules.  This keeps responsibilities clear:

``problem_extractor``  -> decides which accounts are problematic
``problem_case_builder`` -> persists per-account case files
``extract_problematic_accounts`` -> orchestrates the two steps
