# Examples

## Purpose
This directory collects example outputs and supporting documentation so that they remain separate from the main application source code.

## Subfolders
- `client_output/`: sample client-side data produced during development or testing.
- `supporting_docs/`: reference documents and artifacts that accompany the examples.

## Usage
Use these paths when running local experiments or tests that require sample output or documentation.

## Notes
Generated files in this directory should not be committed to production branches.
