# React Frontend

This React application provides a simple interface to interact with the local Flask backend.

## Getting Started

npm run dev
```

The development server runs at `http://localhost:5173` and expects the backend to be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Building for Production

```

Use `npm run lint` to run ESLint checks.
