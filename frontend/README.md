# React Frontend

This React application provides a simple interface to interact with the local Flask backend.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs at `http://localhost:5173`. Configure the backend base URL via the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Use `npm run lint` to run ESLint checks.
